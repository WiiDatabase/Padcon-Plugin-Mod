# Padcon Plugin for the Wii U Plugin System

This plugin for the Wii U Plugin System turns the Wii U GamePad screen off, but keeps it on as a controller. Modified version of the [Padcon plugin](https://github.com/Maschell/WUPSPluginPlayground/tree/master/padcon) by Maschell. I just cleaned it up and changed the button combination.

## Installation

1. Install Aroma
2. Check the Releases page and download the latest version of this plugin
3. Extract it to "`SD://wiiu/environments/aroma/plugins`"
4. Done!

## Usage

While the plugin is active, press `ZL` + `ZR` + `L` + `R` + `PLUS` together to turn off the screen. The GamePad will still be usable as a controller.
